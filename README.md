# Diabetes Risk Analysis (Python)

## Problem Statement
Diabetes is a chronic health condition with increasing global prevalence. Early identification of individuals at high risk is essential for effective prevention and timely intervention.  
This project addresses the problem of identifying key clinical and demographic factors associated with diabetes risk by analyzing patient health data using exploratory data analysis techniques.

---

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze patient health records to identify significant risk factors related to diabetes and to generate data-driven insights that support early detection and informed healthcare decision-making.

---

## Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of anonymized patient health records that include:
- Demographic attributes  
- Clinical measurements  
- Physiological and lifestyle indicators  

The dataset was explored to uncover patterns and relationships associated with diabetes risk.

---

## Tools and Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Exploratory Data Analysis

---

## Data Preparation
The following preprocessing steps were performed:
- Validation of missing values and overall data consistency  
- Handling of outliers in clinical measurements  
- Feature transformation to improve analysis readiness  
- Removal of redundant or low-impact attributes  

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis
The analysis focused on:
- Distribution of diabetic and non-diabetic patients  
- Relationships between glucose levels, BMI, age, and diabetes occurrence  
- Comparison of high-risk and low-risk patient groups  
- Identification of key indicators influencing diabetes risk  

---

## Key Insights
- Elevated glucose levels show a strong association with diabetes occurrence  
- Higher BMI and increased age groups demonstrate greater diabetes risk  
- Certain clinical features contribute more significantly to risk stratification  
- Combined risk factors provide more meaningful insight than isolated attributes  

---

## Healthcare Insights and Applications
- Early identification of high-risk patients can support preventive healthcare strategies  
- Data-driven risk analysis can assist clinicians in prioritizing screening efforts  
- Analytical insights can improve awareness of modifiable diabetes risk factors
